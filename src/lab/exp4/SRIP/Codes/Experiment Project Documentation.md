# Experiment Project Documentation
## Introduction 
This  document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

## Project 
**Domain Name :** Civil Engineering

**Lab Name :**  Soil Mechanics Lab

**Experiment Name :** Grain Size Distribution Experiment

Soils having particle larger than 0.075 mm size are termed as coarse grained soils. In these soils more than 50% of the total material by mass is larger 75 micron. Coarse grained soil may have boulder, cobble, gravel and sand. 

The following particle classification names are given depending on the size of the particle:
1. BOULDER: particle size is more than 300 mm. 
2. COBBLE: particle size in range 80 mm to 300 mm. 
3. GRAVE (G): particle size in range 4.75 mm to 80 mm. 
			  1. Coarse Gravel: 20 to 80 mm. 
			  2. Fine Gravel: 4.75 mm to 20 mm. 
4. SAND (S): particle size in range 0.075 mm to 4.75 mm. 
		  1. Coarse sand: 2.0 mm to 4.75 mm 
		  2. Medium Sand: 0.075 mm to 0.425 mm. 
		  3. Fine Sand: 0.075 mm to o.425 mm


## Purpose of the project 
The purpose of the project is to convert the Grain Size Distribution Experiment simulation from Flash to JavaScript.

## Process Followed to convert the experiment

1)   Understand the assigned experiment Flash simulation.
2)   Understanding the experiment concept.
3)   Re-implement the same in javascript.

## Value Added by our Project
1)   It would be beneficial for engineering students.
2)   Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand the concept of Soil Mechanics in Grain Size Distribution Experiment.

## Risks and Challenges
1) Performing slideshow by preloading the images.
2) Animation Control on same page using two different buttons.
3) Hiding/displaying buttons using *onclick events*. 

## Issues
  None
